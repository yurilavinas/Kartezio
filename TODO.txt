random drops performance sometimes, chooses bad points
    more models the best
the other convergence as soon, dont lose performance, 
    small increments at the end
    the other less models
    converges sooner and with more consistency - show that with evolution of boxplots

see if the model is converging before a new image is added

analysis images selected


#### future work
dynamic metric for choosing on when to add new img
